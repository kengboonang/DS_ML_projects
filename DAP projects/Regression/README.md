There are a lot of different jupyter notebooks processing different parts of the models and features during the whole project. Hence, I've compiled these 2 to serve as a summary of what I did.

1. 6_3_2023: file containing all the data-cleaning, feature extraction and selection and model tuning
2. DAP HDB Data Cleaning: an example of data-cleaning and data-collection from HDB, OneMap and Google Places
